# o2pr-dental-panoramic-radiographs-dataset-preprocessing-for-instance-segmentation

If you find it helpful, please consider giving it a starðŸŒŸ.

We mainly use the "Dataset and code" for the instance segmentation. 

But there are some problems in the `train.json` and `test.json` files. 
The main problem is that not all the images are included in the annotation files. 
So we decide to remove the images that not in the json.
- ## 1. Dataset source
These datasets come from the paper ["Childrenâ€™s dental panoramic radiographs dataset"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02237-5)[1]. They claim that the "dataset and code" are from [2].
You can obtain these datasets from the publication references.
